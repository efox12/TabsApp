# TabsApp
This is an android money managing application to manage group expenses across a connected service. People can create a "tab" with a group of friends and enter various expenses into the app along with descriptions. Their expenses will be logged in the group page and the app will automatically balence the costs and indicate how much money everybody owes each other. This application supports cross phone communication and online storage through a firebase database. This app was the final project for mobile application development.
